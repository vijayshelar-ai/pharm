# Pharmacy Management System - Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. Architecture & Design

**Q: Explain the overall architecture of your pharmacy management system.**
A: The system follows a three-tier architecture:
- Frontend: Built with Tkinter for GUI
- Business Logic: Python classes and functions for core functionality
- Database: MySQL for data persistence
The system is split into multiple modules:
- Login/Registration System (reg.py)
- Main Pharmacy Management (pharmacy.py)
- Admin Dashboard (Admin.py)

**Q: What design patterns did you use in this project?**
A: Several key patterns were implemented:
- Singleton: For database connections
- MVC Pattern: Separating data, logic and presentation
- Observer Pattern: For updating UI elements based on data changes
- Factory Pattern: For creating various UI elements consistently

## 2. Security

**Q: How do you handle user authentication and password security?**
A: The system implements several security measures:
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Email verification using OTP for registration
- Session management to prevent unauthorized access
- Separate admin and user access levels
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection

**Q: How do you prevent unauthorized access to the admin dashboard?**
A: Multiple security layers:
```python
def __init__(self, root, current_user):
    if current_user is None:
        messagebox.showerror("Access Denied", "Direct access not allowed!")
        root.destroy()
        return
```
- User must login through proper channels
- Admin credentials are verified against admin_login table
- Session tracking prevents direct URL access

## 3. Database

**Q: Explain your database schema and relationships.**
A: The system uses three main tables:
1. `login` - For regular users:
   - id, username, password(hashed), email
2. `admin_login` - For administrators:
   - id, username, password(hashed), email
3. `pharmacy` - For medicine data:
   - ref, company_name, type_med, med_name, lot_no, etc.

**Q: How do you handle database connections and prevent connection leaks?**
A: Using context management and proper cleanup:
```python
try:
    conn = connection.MySQLConnection(...)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # operations
finally:
    if 'conn' in locals() and conn.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()
```

## 4. Features

**Q: Explain the AI chatbot feature in your system.**
A: The chatbot provides medicine-related information:
- Uses natural language processing to understand queries
- Fetches medicine information from database
- Handles queries about prices, dosage, side effects, etc.
- Provides context-aware responses based on available data

**Q: How do you handle medicine inventory management?**
A: Through comprehensive CRUD operations:
- Add new medicines with detailed information
- Update existing medicine details
- Track stock levels
- Monitor expiry dates
- Search functionality for quick access

## 5. Error Handling

**Q: How do you handle errors and exceptions in your system?**
A: Multiple layers of error handling:
```python
try:
    # Database operations
except mysql.connector.Error as err:
    messagebox.showerror("Database Error", f"Error: {str(err)}")
except Exception as e:
    messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
finally:
    # Cleanup operations
```
- Specific error handling for database operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging
- Graceful error recovery

**Q: How do you validate user inputs?**
A: Multiple validation methods:
- Regular expressions for username/email validation
- Data type checking for numerical inputs
- Length and format validation
- Special character handling
- Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection

## 6. UI/UX

**Q: Explain the user interface design choices.**
A: The UI was designed for ease of use:
- Intuitive navigation with clear button labels
- Consistent color scheme and layout
- Responsive feedback for user actions
- Clear error messages and confirmations
- Tabbed interface for organized data presentation

**Q: How do you ensure the application is responsive?**
A: Several techniques:
- Asynchronous database operations
- Efficient data loading and pagination
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Background processing for heavy tasks
- Regular UI updates without freezing

## 7. Testing

**Q: How did you test your application?**
A: Comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for database operations
- User acceptance testing
- Edge case testing for error handling
- Security testing for authentication

**Q: How do you handle system updates and maintenance?**
A: Through structured processes:
- Version control using Git
- Regular database backups
- Modular code for easy updates
- Documentation for maintenance
- Change logging for tracking updates

## 8. Scalability

**Q: How scalable is your system?**
A: The system is designed for scalability:
